            <p>Welcome to JAVA .Popular for its versatility and ability to create a wide variety of applications, learning Java opens up your possibilities when coding. With it, you’ll be able to develop large systems, software, and mobile applications — and even create mobile apps for Android. Learn important Java coding fundamentals and practice your new skills with realworld projects.

INTRODUCTION TO JAVA:
 Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, 
making it a popular choice for enterprise level applications.

<p> ABOUT JAVA :

Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
  In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized 
products such as the Java Enterprise System

<p>What is Java?
  Java is aprogramming languageand a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
  Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name wasOak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
  Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment 
(JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
  Java is anobject-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used 
robust technology</p>
       <p>Features of Java:
 The primary objective of Java programminglanguage creation was to make it portable, simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also 
some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.
A list of the most important features of the Java language is 
given below:
 Simple
 Object-oriented
 Platform Independent
 Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java 
language is a simple programming language because:
 Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
 Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
 Java is anobject-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior
 Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C , C++ , etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program 
runs

Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
 • No explicit pointer
 • Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
 • Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.
 • Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
 Robustexplicitly 
• Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
 Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application 
developer 
through 
SSL, 
JAAS, 
Cryptography, 
The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:
 It uses strong memory management.There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points 
make Javarobust.
 etc.
 Architecture-neutral
  Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features,
  for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.
  In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 
64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.
  Portable
  Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any 
implementation.
  High-performanc</p>

<p> Let's see what is the meaning of class, public,Parameters used in First Java Programstatic, void, main, String[], System.out.println().
  class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.
  public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It 
means it is visible to all.
  static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() 
method. So, it saves memory.
  void is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return 
any value.
  main represents the starting point of the program.
  String[] args or String args[] is used for command line argument. We will discuss it in coming section.
  System.out.println() is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class. We will discuss the internal working of System.out.println() statement in the coming section.
<p>Conclusion:
  Java project is a valuable endeavor for aspiring developers. Here are some key points to consider:
  Object-Oriented Language: Java is anobject-oriented programming languagedesigned to run code on various platforms without recompilation. It remains 
one of the most popular and in-demand languages.
  Compile-Time Error Checking: Java projects providerigorous compile-time error checking, akin to Pascal. This feature allows instructors to introduce students to 
essential concepts like GUI programming, networking, and multithreading used in modern software development.
  Versatility: Learning Java equips developers with a versatile skill set, opening up opportunities to work on complex applications. Its widespread use 
ensures that Java will remain relevant for years to come12
